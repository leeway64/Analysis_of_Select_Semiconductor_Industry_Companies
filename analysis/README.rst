Analysis of Select Semiconductor Industry Companies
=====================================================

Introduction
-------------

The semiconductor industry is perhaps the most important industry of the 21st century. It provides
the backbone to most of the advanced technology we almost always take for granted. Without
semiconductors, mobile phones, computers, and the internet would not be possible.

So, I wanted to try to explain the statistics of some of the most advanced companies in the world.

Analysis
----------

Notice how TSMC's stock price is leagues ahead of SMIC, Intel, or even Samsung. The likeliest reason for this is because
TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation) is simply the most advanced chip maker on the planet;
companies such as Apple, Disney, or Alibaba would be nowhere without TSMC ("The pivot").

It should be noted that SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturer International Corporation), the largest
Chinese semiconductor manufacturing company (citation missing), has the lowest stock price of the four. If that is
any indication of the state of China's semiconductor industry, despite the massive state investments poured into
semiconductors (citation needed), then China's nascent semiconductor industry is still leagues behind
its North American and Asian counterparts.

"Without prior expertise you are lost", says The Economist ("The pivot"). China would do well to remember that. Even if
another company could match TSMC's capabilities, TSMC would already be working on the next generation
of its fabs ("The pivot"), the factories it uses to create the backbone of the modern age. It is an
incredibly effective cycle. Developing the most advanced technology first allows TSMC to earn more profit by
charging higher prices, which allows it to invest in the next generation of technology, and so it
continues ("Taiwan Semiconductor").

Do not be tricked by absolute numbers. TSMC, although it has lower net revenue and spends less on R & D than Intel,
is most definitely the leader of this pack (more information needed).

Samsung Electronics' astronomical profit can be attributed to how it is not purely a semiconductor
manufacturing company; it manufactures everything from smartphones to washing machines. Even with $115bn set aside 
to be invested in its chipmaking business over the next decade ("Chip wars"), it is still barely able to keep up
with TSMC, of which Samsung Electronics is its remaining competitor ("Taiwan Semiconductor").

SMIC, as can be seen from its stock price and gross profit, is dwarfed by its superiors. For instance, where Intel has
$55.4bn in assets, SMIC only has $7.8bn ("Chip wars").

Conclusion
------------

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's position is unassailable; as a result, the Republic of China
(commonly referred to as Taiwan) is indirectly one of the most powerful countries on the planet.

Intel's healthy net revenue, coupled with high R & D (research and development) spending, places it at a
competitively viable position; the company for which Silicon Valley was named for will doubtless survive. Furthermore,
the Biden administration has announced a $50bn government plan to resurrect semiconductor chips
manufacturing in the United States. Although it is uncertain whether this will allow Intel to retake
the manufacturing crown, ("Taiwan Semiconductor"), it will still help Intel's prospects.

Samsung Electronics will remain a viable force in the future; the lumbering South Korean behemoth will continue
to lumber on, if by nothing else but sheer inertia.

SMIC, on the other hand, is a minnow in a sea full of ruthless leviathans who have cut their teeth
on hardship itself. It clearly has its work cut out for it, both in terms of improving its share price and
gross profit.
