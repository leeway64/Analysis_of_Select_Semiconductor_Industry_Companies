Analysis of Select Semiconductor Industry Companies
====================================================

Motivation
-----------

The semiconductor industry is perhaps the most important industry of the 21st century. It provides
the backbone to most of the advanced technology we almost always take for granted. Without
semiconductors, mobile phones, computers, and the internet would not be possible.

This project analyzes the relative strengths of some of the most important manufacturers in the 
semiconductor industry; the companies included in this study are Intel, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company), Samsung Electronics, and SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International
Corporation).
